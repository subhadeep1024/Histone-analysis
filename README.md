# Histone analysis

Run new_readme.sh. It calls 2 scripts auto.sh and parser_Histone.pl

instructions: create a directory and plave the head and the child files there. 

auto.sh is hard coded. it reuires tmp_merged_d10_up10_down10 and the histone peak bed files at proper directories (see the code and change accordingly).

parser_Histone.pl uses the output of auto.sh. It needs the name of the cell lines as input. it also needs the fle GENCODE list that contains the transcript id of GENCODE TSSs.
